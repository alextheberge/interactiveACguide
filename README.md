# Interactive Automotive AC Troubleshooting Guide - README

## üëã Welcome!

This interactive guide is designed to help you diagnose common issues with your car's air conditioning system using readings from an AC manifold gauge set. By inputting your vehicle's refrigerant type, the current ambient temperature, and your low-side and high-side pressure readings, this tool will provide potential diagnostic scenarios and suggested troubleshooting steps.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use This Guide

1. **Open the `index.html` File:**

    * Save the HTML code provided previously as an `index.html` file (or any name ending in `.html`).

    * Open this file in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari).

2. **Navigate to the "Diagnostic Dashboard":**

    * This is the main interactive section of the tool.

3. **Input Your Vehicle's Data:**

    * **Refrigerant Type:** Select the type of refrigerant your vehicle uses (e.g., R-134a, R-1234yf) from the dropdown menu. This is crucial as pressure characteristics vary between refrigerants.

    * **Ambient Temperature:** Use the slider to set the current outside air temperature (¬∞F) where you are performing the test.

    * **Low Side (Blue) PSI:** Use the slider to input the pressure reading from the blue (low-side) gauge on your manifold set.

    * **High Side (Red) PSI:** Use the slider to input the pressure reading from the red (high-side) gauge on your manifold set.

4. **Review the "Pressure Analysis":**

    * The bar chart will visually compare your entered low and high-side pressures against the typical normal operating ranges for the selected refrigerant and ambient temperature.

    * The "Normal Low Range" and "Normal High Range" values are also displayed below the chart for clarity.

5. **Consult the "Diagnosis & Next Steps":**

    * Based on your inputs, this section will automatically update to display a diagnostic scenario.

    * This includes:

        * **Scenario Title:** A summary of the pressure readings (e.g., "Low Side LOW / High Side LOW").

        * **Common Symptoms:** What you might be experiencing with your AC.

        * **Likely Cause(s):** The most probable reasons for these readings.

        * **Diagnostic Steps:** A list of actions you can take to further investigate or confirm the issue.

6. **Explore "Reference Information" (Optional):**

    * Below the main tool, you'll find tabs for:

        * **System Overview:** A brief explanation of how car AC systems work.

        * **Component Details:** Information on common issues with key AC components.

        * **When to Call a Pro:** Guidance on situations where professional help is recommended.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER ‚ö†Ô∏è

**This guide is for informational and educational purposes ONLY. It is NOT a replacement for the advice, diagnosis, or services of a qualified and certified automotive HVAC technician or mechanic.**

* **Safety First:** Working on automotive AC systems can be dangerous. Refrigerants are under pressure and can cause frostbite or other injuries if handled improperly. Always wear appropriate safety gear, including eye protection and gloves.

* **Complexity:** AC systems are complex. Misdiagnosis or incorrect repairs can lead to further damage to your vehicle or ineffective cooling.

* **Environmental Regulations:** Refrigerants are regulated substances. Venting them into the atmosphere is illegal in most places and harmful to the environment. Specialized equipment is required for recovering and recycling refrigerant.

* **Accuracy:** While this tool aims to provide accurate guidance based on common scenarios, every vehicle and situation can be unique. The information provided may not cover all possible issues or apply to every specific vehicle model.

* **No Liability:** The creator(s) of this guide assume no liability for any damage, injury, or loss resulting from the use or misuse of the information provided herein. You use this information at your own risk.

**If you are unsure about any step, lack the proper tools, or are uncomfortable performing any of the diagnostic procedures, PLEASE consult a professional automotive technician.**
